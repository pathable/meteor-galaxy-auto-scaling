# CI
Usually you will run Meteor Galaxy Auto Scaling (mgas) in a CI server to have it running all the
 time.

## How to set up your CI

### Jenkins

[JobDSL](https://jenkinsci.github.io/job-dsl-plugin/) plugin is a great way to configure Jenkins
 without using the UI, this way you will have code setting up Jenkins for you automatically.
 
 First make sure you have mgas installed in your CI server
 `yarn global add @pathable/meteor-galaxy-auto-scaling`, ideally you would create a job also for
  this then you could easily update.
  
 Follow one example of how to set up `mgas` with this plugin to run every two minutes to auto
 -scale two different apps.
```
def generatedBy = "Generated by groovy using JobDSL plugin at ${new Date()}"
job("meteor_galaxy_auto_scaling") {
    description generatedBy
    scm {
        git("git@github.com:org/repo.git", "master")
    }

    triggers {
        cron("*/2 * * * *")
    }

    wrappers {
        timeout {
            absolute(minutes = 10)
        }
    }

    steps {
        shell("""
            `yarn global bin`/mgas --settings path/to/settings/in/your/workspace/app1.json
            `yarn global bin`/mgas --settings path/to/settings/in/your/workspace/app2.json
        """)
    }
    configure {
        it / 'publishers' / 'jenkins.plugins.slack.SlackNotifier'(plugin: "slack@2.3") {
            notifyFailure(true)
            notifyBackToNormal(true)
            notifyRepeatedFailure(true)
        }
    }
}
```

You can also include a label setting if you want to run this process in a different Jenkins slave
 node. 
```
    label('meteor-galaxy-auto-scaling')
```
