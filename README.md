# Meteor Galaxy Auto Scaling (mgas)
NodeJS command line tool to monitor and auto-scale Meteor Galaxy

## Features
- Monitoring: reads Galaxy and Meteor APM metrics
- Alerts: reports containers and apps not running as expected
- Auto-scaling: take actions when specific conditions are met
- Send slack notifications: updates, alerts and autos-scaling messages;

## How to use
Set up in your CI or equivalent a job to call `mgas` (meteor-galaxy-auto-scaling) command from
 time to time, it's probably a good idea to use a very short period, like every 2 minutes then
  you will be always monitoring your containers.
  
First you need to install `mgas` (meteor-galaxy-auto-scaling) using yarn or npm: 
```
yarn global add @pathable/meteor-galaxy-auto-scaling
``` 
```
npm install -g @pathable/meteor-galaxy-auto-scaling
```

Then you run it informing a configuration file with your alerts and auto-scaling rules:
```
mgas --settings settings.json
```
You can have different settings for different purposes.


## Updates
Check the [log of changes](./CHANGELOG.md).

## Auto scale rules

The autoscaling (`autoscaleRules`) behavior is meant to adjust smartly the containers on the
 Galaxy server taking
 into account the data got from there and a predefined configuration.

- Three actions are supported:
  - `add` containers (conditions are configured on `addWhen` json key);
  - `reduce` containers (conditions are configured on `reduceWhen` json key);
  - `kill` containers (conditions are configured on `killWhen` json key).

- The conditions available are: "[responseTime|cpu|memory|sessions][Above|Below]".

- The conditions express the property average on the active containers. The active containers are
 those that are running, the ones starting or stopping are ignored.

- Multiple conditions can be informed and they are evaluated in different ways depending on the
 action
  - `add` action evaluates with `OR`, one match is enough to add new container
  - `reduce` action evaluates with `AND`, one miss match is enough to not remove one container
  - `kill` action evaluates with `AND`, one miss match is enough to not kill the container

- The `addWhen` and `reduceWhen` behaviors check to not go beyond a containers count range. This range is described by the `minContainers` and `maxContainers` configuration.

- The `addWhen` and `reduceWhen` behaviors won't run if a scaling is happening. If any other condition passes it will run on the next run.

- The `killWhen` behavior tries to kill the container with high CPU consumption and that matches the conditions configured.

- An slack message is sent anytime a scaling behavior is triggered if you set a Slack Webhook, the
 messages are sent to the default webhook channel. You will receive messages like this
 
![info](./docs/auto-scaling.png)

## Alerts
You can set maximum limits for container metrics (CPU, memory and connected clients) and also for
 Meteor app metrics (response time for publications and methods).

Example:
```
"alertRules": {
    "maxInContainers": {
      "cpu": 1,
      "memory": 10,
      "clients": 5
    },
    "maxInApp": {
      "pubSubResponseTime": 200,
      "methodResponseTime": 300
    }
},
"minimumStats": 5,
```
You will receive an alert like this when at least `minimumStats` times in a row the current value
 was above the maximum expected.

![info](./docs/alert.png)

  Then if you run `mgas` every 2 minutes and use `minimumStatus
  ` as 5 you will get an alert when your metric is at least 10 minutes above the maximum expected
  . 
 
 `minimumStats` is set in the first level of the settings because maybe we will use this
  information in
  the future also for auto-scaling, for now auto-scaling is not considering the `minimumStats`
   value.
 
## Info rules
- Set the channel, by default will go to default webhook channel
- You will receive messages like this

![info](./docs/info.png)

## Developing
If you want to include new features that includes reading new data from Galaxy or Meteor APM you
 will probably want to run `puppeteer` watching the actions, then change `headless` setting to
  `false`.
 
```
  "puppeteer": {
    "headless": false
  }
```

## Troubleshooting
