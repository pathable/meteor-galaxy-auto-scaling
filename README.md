## Auto scale rules

The autoscaling behavior is meant to adjust smartly the containers on the Galaxy server taking into account the data got from there and a predefined configuration. This behavior is part of the process that reports the alerts of the galaxy state, so it is run each X minutes.

- You are able to tweak the configuration for each app by setting the conditions to run the add containers (`addWhen`), reduce containers (`reduceWhen`) or kill containers (`killWhen`) behaviors.

- The conditions available are: "[responseTime|cpu|sessions][Above|Below]". You can check the examples on this PR.

- The conditions express the property average on the active containers. The active containers are those that are running, not being starting or stoping.

- The conditions are solved by an `AND`. Any condition absence means to not consider it for the checking. So, if we only provide to `addWhen` behavior the `responseTimeAbove: 300` condition, such behavior will only run every time the response time are above 300ms.

- The `addWhen` and `reduceWhen` behaviors check to not go beyond a containers count range. This range is described by the `minContainers` and `maxContainers` configuration.

- The `addWhen` and `reduceWhen` behaviors won't run if a scaling is happening. If any other condition passes it will run on the next run.

- The `killWhen` behavior tries to kill the container with high CPU consumption and that matches the conditions configured.

- An slack alert is sent anytime a scaling behavior is triggered.
